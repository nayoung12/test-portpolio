            touch wood<br>
            <br>
            'touch wood' is an exhibition of photographs and installations held in Tokyo in September 2023 and in Ishikawa in October 2023.<br>
            touch wood: a magic spell born from an mythology.<br>
            - It is said that if you touch a wooden object and chant "touch wood," the thing dwelling in it will protect you. They believe that the forests and trees are inhabited by spirits and protect us from bad things.<br>
            <br>
            The trees live on even though it changes its shape.<br>
            <br>
            I used photographs to express the things that protect me in my daily life and the signs of their presence.
